# SR-GEO-PoC: Schumann Resonance Geophysical Precursor Correlation Framework

This repository presents the SR-GEO-PoC framework: an open-access scientific model for identifying electromagnetic and ionospheric anomalies prior to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

By cross-correlating Schumann Resonance shifts, Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies, geomagnetic data, gravity changes, and transient luminous events (TLEs), SR-GEO-PoC offers a reproducible structure for investigating crustal energy buildup leading to natural disasters.

## 🧠 Theory Overview

> Crustal stress rises → EM signals propagate upward → Schumann & ionospheric disturbances emerge → Lightning/TLEs increase → Event rupture follows.
