# üåç SR-GEO-PoC: Schumann Resonance & Geophysical Anomaly Correlation

## Overview
SR-GEO-PoC is a scientific research initiative that proposes a unified model connecting Schumann Resonance (SR), Total Electron Content (TEC), infrared anomalies, gravity shifts, and EM events. The framework identifies consistent precursor signals linked to major geophysical events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

## Features
- Multi-layer signal correlation model
- 5 validated global case studies
- Open-access whitepaper and event matrix
- Early-warning system applications
