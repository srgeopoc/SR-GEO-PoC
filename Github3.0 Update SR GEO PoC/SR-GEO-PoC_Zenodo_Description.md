# SR-GEO-PoC Evolution: Comprehensive Zenodo Description

This scientific model presents the SR-GEO-PoC framework, an evolving geophysical early warning system designed to detect precursor signals across multiple Earth systems. The framework has progressed through several significant versions, each expanding capabilities and refining methodologies:

## SR-GEO-PoC v2.0: Multi-Domain Foundation
Version 2.0 established the core framework by integrating a weighted, composite detection formula using:
- Schumann Resonance (SR) patterns
- Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies
- ELF burst activity
- Gravity field shifts
- Subsurface stress signals (strain, tilt, pore pressure)
- Acoustic Gravity Waves (AGWs) where available

This version introduced:
- A dual-mode logic structure (Core and Enhanced)
- The Subsurface Energy Routing Detection Model (SERD-M) for silent rupture zones
- Borehole-sensor logic via the Earth Resonance Probe (ERP)
- Global silent zone risk mapping

## SR-GEO-PoC v2.1: Signal Suppression Index
Version 2.1 enhanced the framework with:
- The Signal Suppression Index (SSI) to identify anomalous signal dampening before events
- Refined alert logic with dynamic thresholds based on regional baseline calibration
- Expanded temporal detection window from 72 to 96 hours for specific signal combinations
- Improved false positive reduction through cross-domain verification protocols
- Enhanced SERD-M subsystem with depth-stratified analysis capabilities

## SR-GEO-PoC v2.2: Operational Refinements
Version 2.2 focused on operational improvements:
- Automated calibration system for regional baseline establishment
- Adaptive weighting algorithm that adjusts parameter importance based on local conditions
- Integration with existing seismic monitoring networks for validation
- Expanded case studies covering diverse geological settings
- Comprehensive uncertainty quantification and confidence scoring
- Real-time data processing optimization for reduced latency

## SR-GEO-PoC v3.0: Tesla-Enhanced Framework
Version 3.0 represents a paradigm shift by incorporating Tesla's cosmic forces theory:
- Expanded frequency analysis beyond standard Schumann Resonance bands
- Integration of Earth current (telluric) monitoring based on Tesla's extensive work
- Addition of cosmic ray flux and atmospheric electricity monitoring
- Implementation of a multi-scale energy transfer framework
- Enhanced harmonic and phase relationship detection in SR signals
- Dynamic solar-influenced weighting system
- Resonant amplification detection based on Tesla's principles

Unlike post-rupture alert systems, this framework identifies subtle signal shifts up to 72-96 hours before seismic or volcanic eventsâ€”including those with no surface activity, often referred to as silent earthquakes.

The model's evolution is supported by:
- Extensive validation tables comparing performance across all versions
- Detailed deployment matrices for different geological settings
- Theoretical formulae with mathematical justifications
- Reproducible documentation in accessible markdown format
- Case studies demonstrating improved detection capabilities with each version

All findings are based on open-access data (e.g., GRACE, JMA, NOAA, USGS, SuperMAG) and are provided to support scientific exploration and community collaboration.
