# How Cosmic Forces Shape Our Destinies
## A Summary of Nikola Tesla's Essay

### Introduction

In his essay "How Cosmic Forces Shape Our Destinies," published in the New York American on February 7, 1915, Nikola Tesla presents a mechanistic view of human existence and explores how cosmic and environmental forces influence human behavior and societal events. Tesla argues that humans are essentially "self-propelled automata" whose actions are governed by external influences rather than internal will.

### Key Arguments

#### 1. The Mechanistic Theory of Life

Tesla begins by establishing his foundational premise: every living being is "an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe." He builds upon Descartes' mechanistic theory of life, which viewed animals as automata without consciousness and recognized humans as machines with distinctive qualities. Tesla extends this view, arguing that all human actions are governed by external forces rather than internal will.

Tesla outlines five key principles of his mechanistic theory:

1. **Humans as Automata**: "The human being is a self-propelled automaton entirely under the control of external influences. Willful and predetermined though they appear, his actions are governed not from within, but from without. He is like a float tossed about by the waves of a turbulent sea."

2. **No Permanent Memory**: "There is no memory or retentive faculty based on lasting impression. What we designate as memory is but increased responsiveness to repeated stimuli."

3. **Brain as Processor, Not Storage**: "It is not true, as Descartes taught, that the brain is an accumulator. There is no permanent record in the brain, there is no stored knowledge. Knowledge is something akin to an echo that needs a disturbance to be called into being."

4. **Visual Primacy in Knowledge**: "All knowledge or form conception is evoked through the medium of the eye, either in response to disturbances directly received on the retina or to their fainter secondary effects and reverberations. Other sense organs can only call forth feelings which have no reality of existence and of which no conception can be formed."

5. **Accuracy of Visual Perception**: "Contrary to the most important tenet of Cartesian philosophy that the perceptions of the mind are illusionary, the eye transmits to it the true and accurate likeness of external things."

#### 2. Cosmic Forces Acting on Humans

Tesla meticulously catalogs the various cosmic and environmental forces that act upon the human "automaton":

- **Rotational Energy**: At the equator, a 160-pound person carries nearly 5,780,000 foot-pounds of mechanical energy due to Earth's rotation.

- **Solar Gravitational Influence**: The sun alternately increases and diminishes a person's normal weight by about one-tenth of a pound.

- **Earth's Orbital Motion**: The Earth's movement around the sun imparts over 25,160,000,000 foot-pounds of energy to a person, varying by approximately 1,533,000,000 foot-pounds every twelve hours.

- **Solar System Movement**: The solar system's movement toward the constellation Hercules creates annual energy flux changes that may reach "over one hundred billion foot pounds."

- **Electrical Potential**: The human body exists at an electric potential of two billion volts, which "fluctuates violently and incessantly."

- **Environmental Forces**: Atmospheric pressure (16-20 tons), solar radiation (about 40 foot-pounds per second), bombardment by solar particles, sound waves, Earth's tremors, temperature changes, rain, and wind all continuously affect the human body.

#### 3. Individual and Collective Behavior

Tesla explains how these cosmic forces lead to both individual and collective behaviors:

- **Individual Differences**: Despite being subjected to similar cosmic forces, humans react differently because "there is concordance in response to those disturbances only which are most frequently repeated, not to all."

- **Sleep Patterns**: Tesla argues that sleep is "not an indispensable physiological necessity" but rather "a condition gradually imposed upon us by the diurnal revolution of the globe," serving as evidence for his mechanistic theory.

- **Rhythmic Patterns**: Tesla observes rhythms in "ideas and opinions, in financial and political movements, in every department of our intellectual activity," attributing these to physical systems of mass inertia.

#### 4. Wars and Catastrophes as Cosmic Phenomena

Tesla applies his mechanistic theory to explain wars and other societal upheavals:

- **Wars as Cosmic Events**: "Though it may seem so, a war can never be caused by arbitrary acts of man. It is invariably the more or less direct result of cosmic disturbance in which the sun is chiefly concerned."

- **Solar Influence on Conflicts**: Tesla notes that in many historical conflicts, "the direct dependence of the sun is unmistakable," particularly those "precipitated by famine, pestilence or terrestrial catastrophes."

- **Earthquakes and Warfare**: Tesla draws connections between mechanical warfare effects and earthquakes, suggesting that "the earth may be thrown into convulsions through mechanical effects such as are produced in modern warfare."

### Conclusion

Tesla's essay presents a deterministic view of human existence, arguing that all human actions and societal events are ultimately governed by cosmic forces rather than free will. He sees humans as complex machines responding to external stimuli, with the sun playing a particularly significant role in shaping both individual behavior and major historical events like wars.

The essay reflects Tesla's attempt to apply scientific principles to understand human behavior and societal patterns, presenting a worldview where cosmic forces, rather than human agency, are the primary shapers of our destinies.
