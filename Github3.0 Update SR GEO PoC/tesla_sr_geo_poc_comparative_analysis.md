# Tesla's Cosmic Forces Theory and SR-GEO-PoC Model: 
# Comparative Analysis and Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between Nikola Tesla's cosmic forces theory and the SR-GEO-PoC model, a multi-domain correlation framework for precursor signatures in geophysical energy transfer. The analysis reveals significant conceptual alignments between Tesla's early 20th-century ideas and this modern geophysical monitoring framework, particularly in their shared emphasis on energy, frequency, resonance, and precursor detection.

Based on these alignments, we propose several Tesla-inspired enhancements to the SR-GEO-PoC model, including expanded parameter monitoring, dynamic weighting systems, and multi-scale energy transfer concepts. These enhancements could potentially improve the model's predictive capabilities while honoring Tesla's visionary insights on cosmic-terrestrial connections.

## 1. Introduction
