## Statement of Original Work

I, Ashley Clark, hereby affirm that the work titled *"SR-GEO-PoC: A Multi-Domain Correlation Framework for Precursor Signatures in Geophysical Energy Transfer"* is my own original research and intellectual property. This work has not been previously published in any peer-reviewed journal, submitted to any conference, or copied from any external source.

All external studies, data repositories, and literature used to support the hypothesis or referenced in analysis have been properly cited and integrated under scholarly fair use guidelines. All conclusions and models presented are the result of independent synthesis, analysis, and design.

Figures or formulas referenced from external scientific studies are used in accordance with academic fair use and are clearly cited with original author attribution. Visuals that are not originally created by the author are labeled accordingly and are used for scientific comparison and educational insight, not for commercial purposes.

This research has been developed for scientific, humanitarian, and public safety purposes and is shared openly under the Creative Commons Attribution license to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and improved disaster preparedness.

## Unique Scientific Contribution

This work introduces a new conceptual and structural model for detecting geophysical precursor signals by:

- Proposing that **Schumann Resonance responds actively** to crustal pressure and energy transformation.
- Demonstrating a **stacked signal pattern** that occurs hours to days prior to major seismic and volcanic events.
- Validating this pattern across five global events using **Total Electron Content (TEC)**, **SR amplitude**, **gravity field shifts**, **infrared anomalies**, and **electromagnetic activity**.
- Providing a **testable, open-source overlay method** for visual correlation of multi-domain precursor signatures.
- Integrating methodologies and insights drawn from peer-reviewed sources including NASA's cavity resonance modeling and long-term SR monitoring data.
