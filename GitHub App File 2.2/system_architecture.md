# SR-GEO-PoC Tracker System Architecture

## Overview
The SR-GEO-PoC Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize earthquake precursor signals based on the SR-GEO-PoC theory. The system integrates real-time and historical data from multiple sources, implements the SR-GEO-PoC prediction algorithm, and provides an AI-powered assistant for explanations and user questions.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Libraries**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Visualization**: 
  - Leaflet/Mapbox for geospatial mapping
  - D3.js for time-series data visualization
  - Three.js for 3D visualizations (optional)
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for live data streaming

### 2. Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **API Layer**: RESTful API for data access and management
- **WebSocket Server**: Socket.io for real-time updates
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure access (if needed)
- **Data Processing**: Implementation of SR-GEO-PoC algorithm

### 3. Database
- **Primary Database**: MongoDB for flexible schema
- **Time-series Storage**: InfluxDB for efficient time-series data
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

### 4. AI Assistant
- **Integration**: OpenAI API or similar LLM service
- **Context Management**: System to provide data context to AI
- **Knowledge Base**: SR-GEO-PoC theory documentation
- **User Interface**: Chat interface with contextual awareness

### 5. Data Collection
- **Web Scrapers**: Custom scrapers for public data sources
- **Data Normalization**: Standardization across different sources
- **Manual Entry Interface**: For data without real-time sources
- **Scheduled Jobs**: For regular data collection and updates

## Data Flow
1. Data is collected from various sources through scrapers or manual entry
2. Raw data is normalized and stored in the database
3. The SR-GEO-PoC algorithm processes the data to generate predictions
4. Processed data and predictions are sent to the frontend via API/WebSockets
5. Frontend visualizes the data and predictions
6. AI assistant provides explanations and answers user questions

## User Interface
1. **Dashboard**: Overview of current status and alerts
2. **Map View**: Geospatial visualization of potential risk zones
3. **Parameter Panels**: Detailed views of individual parameters
4. **Historical Analysis**: Tools for comparing current and past data
5. **AI Assistant**: Chat interface for questions and explanations
6. **Admin Panel**: For manual data entry and system management

## Deployment Architecture
- **Frontend**: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or similar)
- **Backend**: Node.js server on cloud platform
- **Database**: Managed database service
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Serverless functions for data collection

## Security Considerations
- HTTPS for all communications
- API rate limiting
- Input validation
- Authentication for admin features (if needed)

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for backend services
- Database sharding for large datasets
- CDN for static assets
- Caching strategy for frequent queries
