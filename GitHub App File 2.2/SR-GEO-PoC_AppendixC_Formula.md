# Appendix C: Schumann Resonance Fundamental Equation

The fundamental resonant frequencies of the Earth-ionosphere cavity are derived from the spherical waveguide model. The formula is:

\[
f_n = \frac{c}{2\pi R} \sqrt{n(n+1)}
\]

Where:
- \( f_n \) is the resonant frequency of the nth mode
- \( c \) is the speed of light (~3.00 × 10^8 m/s)
- \( R \) is the mean radius of Earth (~6.371 × 10^6 m)
- \( n \) is the mode number (n = 1 for fundamental, higher for harmonics)

This formula models the Earth-ionosphere cavity as a spherical resonator and is supported by both theoretical and observational SR studies including:

- Schlegel & Füllekrug (2002)
- Simões et al. (2012)
- Ondrášková et al. (2007)

The first few expected modes from this model (assuming ideal cavity) are:
- n = 1 → ~7.83 Hz
- n = 2 → ~14.1 Hz
- n = 3 → ~20.3 Hz

These match well with the actual SR harmonics observed by ground and satellite sensors, supporting their use in energy-transfer modeling.
