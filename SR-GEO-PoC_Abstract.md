## Abstract

This scientific white paper presents SR-GEO-PoC, a reproducible open-source framework for identifying precursor signals prior to seismic and volcanic events by cross-correlating public atmospheric, electromagnetic, and geophysical data. While current early warning systems focus on seismic or thermal activity detected at or after rupture, this study demonstrates that low-frequency signals—such as Schumann Resonance (SR), Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies, gravity field shifts, and transient luminous events (TLEs)—can appear hours to days beforehand.

Using real data from seven global events, including the Tonga eruption (2022), Nepal earthquake (2015), and a June 2021 activity cluster, we found a repeatable upward energy flow: crustal stress accumulation initiates electromagnetic emissions, which alter the Earth-ionosphere cavity and induce observable signals in multiple domains. These shifts are measurable via open satellite, magnetometer, GNSS, and lightning networks.

SR-GEO-PoC is designed to accelerate scientific validation and future integration into early warning systems by using only public data, simple tools, and replicable methods. We invite global researchers and institutions to test, extend, and apply this model in their regions to reduce disaster risk and improve readiness.
