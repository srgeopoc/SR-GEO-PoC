*Mapping Earth's Hidden Energy: A Multi-Domain Correlation Framework Linking Schumann Resonance, Volcanic Activity, and Ionospheric Disturbance*

**Abstract:**  
The Schumann Resonance (SR) is traditionally viewed as a passive background phenomenon driven by global lightning activity. This paper challenges that assumption by proposing a novel multi-domain framework that treats SR not as a secondary effect, but as a sensitive mirror of Earth’s internal geophysical energy dynamics. Building on the principle that energy does not disappear but transforms, we investigate how tectonic stress, magma movement, and underground overpressure produce detectable electromagnetic and atmospheric signatures — long before visible eruption or seismic rupture occurs.

The framework integrates time-aligned data from over a dozen open-access satellite and ground-based sources, including GNSS-derived Total Electron Content (TEC), SR harmonic shifts, volcanic lightning polarity, transient luminous events (TLEs), infrared thermal anomalies, and gravity field redistributions (GRACE). Using the January 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption as a case study, we map the cascade of energy conversion from crustal pressure to atmospheric shockwave to ionospheric disturbance — all culminating in SR cavity modulation and non-storm-based electromagnetic discharge.

Our findings suggest that upward energy flow — from ground to ionosphere — is both measurable and underrepresented in current models. The correlation patterns observed across SR, TEC, and EM fields present a compelling case for the development of early warning indicators based on synchronized anomaly detection. This work introduces a new systems-level lens for understanding the Earth-atmosphere-ionosphere triad and opens a path toward integrated geophysical forecasting.
